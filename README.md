# What to wear, by James Harvey

A fun weekend project using [weatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create a weather app that gives you advice on what to wear or bring with you based on the current weather condition and temperature.

   ```

4. Install the requirements
